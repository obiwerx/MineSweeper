The game Minesweeper is played on an n by n grid. In this grid are hidden m mines, each at a distinct grid location. The player repeatedly touches grid positions. If a position with a mine is touched, the mine explodes and the player loses. If a positon not containing a mine is touched, an integer between 0 and 8 appears denoting the number of adjacent or diagonally adjacent grid positions that contain a mine

Your job is to read the information for a partially played game and to print the corresponding board.

Solution is Kludgy - I did this with only basic knowledge of C++.
